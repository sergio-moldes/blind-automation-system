# Blind Automation System

## Project Description

This project consists of designing an automation system for blinds for domestic use. The goal is to create a system that avoids the need for complex installations, allowing easy assembly or disassembly without altering the existing blinds or roller shutters system. This makes it a complementary system that is simple to install and control.

The continuous advancement of technology and the increasing demand for home automation systems have driven the evolution of such systems. The designed mechanism aims to lift and lower blinds without dismantling or changing existing manual systems, featuring easy installation and connectivity for automating this process.
